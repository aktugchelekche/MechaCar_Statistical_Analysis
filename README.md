# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

A Statisitical analysis on automobile performance with R. 

## Overview
In this project, I will perform a statistical analyisis on production data to discover cause of production troubles that blocking the manufacturing teamâ€™s progress. My goal to perform following statistical tests and models :

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.

#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
In order to answer this question, we have to refer to one of the most important constant in statistics which is known as  <code> p-value </code> probablity valut. In nutshell, if the p-value is below 0.05 is statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model, implies that those variables have a significant impact on <code>mpg</code>. According to Figure 1 : 
* Ground clearance <code>p-value = 5.21 x 10<sup>-8</sup> </code>,
* Vehicle length <code>p-value = 2.60 x 10<sup>-12</sup></code>,
* Intercept <code>p-value = 5.08 x 10<sup>-8</sup></code>

a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. Since the intercept is statistically significant, that implies we can assume that there are other variables and factors can have significant impact to the variation in mpg that have not been included in the model. 

#### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

From the Linear Reggesion model the  <code> p-value</code> of our statistic is <code>5.35 x 10<sup>-11<sup></code>, much lower than significance level of <code>0.05%</code>. Thus,there are sufficient evidence to <strong>reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> :The slope of the linear model is zero</strong>. 
We can conclude that there is a strong linear relationship between variables and mpg of MechaCar prototype. Figure-2 would is showing the linear relation between <code> MPG ~ Vehicle Length </code>.

#### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  
To quantify how well our linear model can be used to predict future observations, our linear regression functions will calculate an r-squared value. The <code>r-squared (r2)</code> value is also known as the coefficient of determination and represents how well the regression model approximates real-world data points. In most cases, the r-squared value will range between 0 and 1 and can be used as a probability metric to determine the likelihood that future data points will fit the linear model.
Yes, from <code>Figure-1</code> we can see that <code>r-squared = 0.7149 </code> which indicates that our model does predict the mpg of the MechaCar prototype with some relative effectiveness.
